### Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- cURL extension
- JSON extension
- mbstring extension

### Notes

This is a **beta release** (v0.9.x) intended for early adopters and development/testing purposes.

**Stability:**
- ✅ The SDK is feature-complete and well-tested
- ✅ Suitable for WooCommerce plugin development and testing
- ⚠️ API may undergo minor refinements before v1.0.0
- ⚠️ Production use should pin to specific version: `"b2brouter/b2brouter-php": "0.9.0"`

**What's Coming in v1.0.0:**
- Potential minor API refinements based on early adopter feedback

**Upgrade Path:**
- Beta users: `^0.9.0` (allows 0.9.1, 0.9.2, etc.)
- After v1.0.0: `^1.0` (semantic versioning guarantees)
